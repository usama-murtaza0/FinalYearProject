          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>For the past few decades, we have been consuming a lot of chemical based personal care and food products. But the worst part is, most people donâ€™t even recognize this as a problem. Despite most of our older generation advising on using organic and locally produced home made products, using non-natural and unsustainable products has become the norm.
          <br>
          After researching on the many complications such products have on skin and health in the longer run, we found the only solution: Increase Knowledge and Production of Chemical-Free Natural Products that are Suitable for Long-Term consumption and are Sustainable for our planet.
          <br>        
          The Organic Store is established with a single mission in mind: to ignite the awareness and work as an ambassador for all organic products in Pakistan. Our goal is to help people learn and shift from conventional chemical based to organic and natural products.</p>
